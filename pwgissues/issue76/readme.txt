-----------------
Transcode
# Some editing of vntxt_0_deva.txt related to transcoding to get invertibility
See change_vntxt_0_deva.txt

python pwg_transcode.py pwgtranscoder1 deva slp1 ../vntxt_0_deva.txt ../vntxt_0.txt
# check invertibility
python pwg_transcode.py pwgtranscoder1 slp1 deva ../vntxt_0.txt tempchk.txt
diff ../vntxt_0_deva.txt tempchk.txt | wc -l
0  # invertibility checks.

commit repo and sync to github.
--------------------------------------------------------------

The transcoding mishandled the udAtta accent (and maybe others?)
 Correct several errors. Mostly the Devanagari combining U change to /
 e.g. aê£« -> a/
Also a few unbalanced parens noticed and changed.
See the 'replacements_data' in the program for details.
cd transcode
