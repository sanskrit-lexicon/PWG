Motivation

There are 7170 entries in PWG matching <ls>MED.</ls>. (More than 5876 matching <ls>MED. .
PWG has not given the verse number because the dictionary is predictable.
Nobody says how you have to search a word in Oxford dictionary.

Medinikosha is arranged in the following systematic but eccentric manner, which make it amenable to linking even without reference to a specific word.

Arrangement is in the following order

    Arrange according to terminal consonant (words ending with consonant 'k' - ignoring vowels at the end)
    Inter se, arrange by number of vowels (one k, two k, three k......)
    Inter se, arrange by the initial letter of the word.

I intend to create an app to link as per the word in SLP1.
e.g. sanskrit-lexicon-scans.github.io/medini/app4/?kfzRa

This would require a new index / modification of existing index.
---------

1. copy existing index (PWG/pwgissues/issue105/medini/medini_index_v1_edit.txt)

cp ../issue105/medini/medini_index_v1_edit.txt medini_v1_orig.txt

2. Create a copy to manually edit

cp medini_v1_orig.txt medini_v2.txt

3. Manually fill details
