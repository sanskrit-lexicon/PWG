What is the prakshipta of the Ramayana?


The term "prakshipta" in the context of the Ramayana refers to interpolated or later added sections of the epic. Specifically, scholarly discussions often center on:

Uttara Kanda:
This final book of the Ramayana is widely considered by many scholars to be a later addition.
Differences in style and narrative inconsistencies compared to the earlier books have led to this view.
The Uttara Kanda contains accounts of Sita's abandonment and the later part of Rama's reign.
Portions of Bala Kanda:
Similar to Uttara Kanda, some sections of the first book, Bala Kanda, are also believed to be later interpolations.
Key points to understand:

The recognition of these "prakshipta" reflects the understanding that the Ramayana, like other ancient texts, may have evolved over time with additions and modifications.
Scholarly analysis of the Ramayana involves examining these variations and attempting to discern the original core text.
Therefore, when people speak of prakshipta within the Ramayana, they are generally refering to the Uttara Kanda, and portions of the Bala Kanda.
