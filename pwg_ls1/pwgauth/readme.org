The prior version of pwg authorities is in folder pwgauth_version0.

* pwgbib.txt
We initialize pwgbib.txt from the latest version used in the meta-line
iast conversion. Namely
cp correctionwork/cologne-issue-190_work/temp_abbrvwork8/pwgbib14d.txt pwgauth/pwgbib.txt

* bibrec.py
This module is adapted from code in the above abbrvwork8 directory.
Specifically, we examine parts of cut_exact1.py 

* pwgbib_input.py
Writes a file with 3 tab-delimited fields, to be used as input
to pwgbib.sqlite
python pwgbib_input.py pwgbib.txt pwgbib_input.txt

* pwgbib.sqlite
Three fields:
 id  = cologne id for bibliographic entry
 code = iast code for entry
 codecap = capitalized code (first letter capital, rest lower)
 text = body of text for entry

* redo.sh
- remake pwgbib_input.txt
- remake pwgbib.sqlite
- move pwgbib.sqlite to web/sqlite
